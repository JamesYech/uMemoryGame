# uMemoryGame

**PURPOSE**

This is the memory game project from Udacitys' Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.


**GAME PLAY**

Click on the cards to flip them face up.  If they match, they will stay face up otherwise they will be flipped face down again.  Play continues until all cards are matched.

Upon finishing the game, a panel will be display with your game stats and the top scores to date.

Clicking the menu icon in the upper left will allow you to change the card faces and reset the top scores.  Changing the face design or reset the top scores, the current game is also reset.

Clicking the reset icon in the upper right will allow you to reset the current game.


**FEATURES**

Top scores are stored locally and will be saved session to session if the users browser permits.


**ISSUES**

Does not work in IE due to use of var() in the css file.  I've opted not to change this.


**CREDITS**

See the footer section of the game for web pages I found useful during the development of this project.
